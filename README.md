ONNX.jl : Read [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) graphs and load these models in Julia. ONNX.jl provides an instance of transfer learning into Julia, by reading pretrained models from ONNX format to [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl). This is done by generating the DataFlow graph from the model, and then reading it as Julia code.

## Loading models

You need to have the `model.onnx` ( or in some cases `model.pb` ) file,  which will be read. Several pretrained ONNX model files can also be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/onnx/models).  Now that we have the `model.onnx` file, we can read it into Flux as :

```
julia> using Flux, ONNX                             # Import the required packages.
julia> weights, model_expr = ONNX.load_model("model.onnx")                # If you are in some other directory, specify the entire path.
                                                    # This creates two files: model.jl and weights.bson.
julia> model = eval(model_expr)                     # eval the model expression into the current module

```
Or alternatively, use include to the load the model from the model.jl file:
julia> model = include("model.jl")                  # Loads the model from the model.jl file
```


And `model` is the corresponding model in Flux!
